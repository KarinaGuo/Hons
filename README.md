Hello! This repository includes the key scripts and data files used for my honours thesis. File paths, file names, and such may need to be changed. Let me know if anything is missing or isn't working. 

/Code - includes code used for the model's accuracy predictions, the model creations, and the analysis of the datasets

/Data - includes files used in code

/leaf_BigLeaf_QC - datasets used to analyse the quality control of our machine learning model, as in Supplementary Information D

/Conda Environments - includes the .yml files of the conda environments used to perform the training/testing/use of the machine learning models, and the extraction of traits from the binary masks of the machine learning model predictions
